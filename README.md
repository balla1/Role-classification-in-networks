# Role-classification-in-networks


This repository contains the materials for my thesis on role-based analysis in complex networks. The methodology combines custom weighting strategies with fuzzy clustering to uncover hidden patterns and dynamics in networks.

## Abstract

This thesis focuses on identifying roles in complex networks using advanced analytical methods. By leveraging custom weighting strategies and fuzzy clustering, it uncovers structural patterns and their evolution over time. The methodology has been applied to various domains, including:

- **Global Trade:** Highlighting economic hierarchies and international relationships.
- **Social Media:** Analyzing user role changes during events like the 2022 Italian elections.

This work provides valuable insights into network structures and their dynamics, offering a flexible approach applicable across multiple fields.
